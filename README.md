# Classifying Kepler Objects of Interest as Exoplanets
## New York University, Introduction to Data Science
### Term Project (with 3 others)
_Using various machine learning algorithms in Python to classify a given Kepler object of interest as an exoplanet based on physical features of the object and its environment_

Data were obtained from the NASA website. Predicting exoplanets saves resources, both financial and human, in the search for other objects in our solar system that are human habitable. Various classification algorithms were explored including simple ones such as decision trees or logistic regression to more complex models involving random forests or adaptive boosting. Even the most simple methods were valuable, but each algorithm was improved upon with a hyperparameter search. The machine learning methods proved valuable in predicting this status and can aid researchers correctly classify any future objects encountered.
